# Migrate from Gitlab
These are scripts to help with a gitlab migration:
 
gitlab_ssh_url_all.sh: pull the ssh url of all repos an account has access to into a file. 
split_repo_list.sh: split the list of repos into smaller chunks 
gitlab_clone_all.sh: clones all repos in the list, if not already present in the destination folder.
